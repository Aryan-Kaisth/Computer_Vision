# ðŸŽ¯ Webcam HSV Color Tracker with Contour Detection

This project is an **interactive color tracking tool** built with Python and OpenCV.  
It uses the **HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value)** color space for accurate color detection  
and allows you to **tune the color range in real-time** using trackbars.

---

## âœ¨ Features
- ðŸŽ› **Real-time HSV Range Adjustment** using OpenCV trackbars.
- ðŸŽ¯ **Object Detection & Tracking** with bounding boxes and center points.
- ðŸŽ¨ **Live Color Preview** showing the average detected color.
- ðŸ§¹ **Noise Filtering** to ignore tiny unwanted detections.
- ðŸ“¸ **Snapshot Saving** with a single key press.
- ðŸ’» Works with **any webcam**.

---

## ðŸ“¸ How It Works
1. The script captures frames from your webcam.
2. Converts them from **BGR â†’ HSV** color space.
3. Applies the selected HSV range as a **mask**.
4. Detects contours of objects within that color range.
5. Draws bounding boxes & center markers on detected objects.
6. Displays a live preview of the detected color.
